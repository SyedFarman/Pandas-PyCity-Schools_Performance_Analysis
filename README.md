# District Schools Performance Analysis
## Project Overview

The scope of the project is to analyze the overall performance of the schools in the district. The analysis is done in two parts, in first we had analyzed the overall performance of district schools and in the second part we analyzed the performance of each school based on the type of school, size of the school, per student budget and the student's math and reading scores

## Results

### District Summary

- Total Budget of all schools is $24.64M
- Average score are 79 in Maths and 81.9 in Reading
- Overall passing % is 65%, where as in Math it is 75% and in Reading it is 86%
